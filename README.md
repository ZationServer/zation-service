## What is Zation-service
The ***zation-service*** is an API that provides interfaces for creating a zation service package. 
A service package can define one or multiple different services.
Also, it has support for building more instances of each specific service with different configurations. 
A use case for this could be to creating more MySQL connections with different settings. 
You can use it to create your own service package, 
for understanding how this works you can look in the interfaces or check out predefined service packages that make use of this package.
Some example packages are the [zation-service-mysql](https://github.com/ZationServer/zation-service-mysql) or [zation-service-nodemailer](https://github.com/ZationServer/zation-service-nodemailer).
